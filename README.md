# DEMOsim

## About

This is an educational [Design & Engineering Method for Organisations](https://ccmi.fit.cvut.cz/methodologies/demo) simulator. By providing a model defining transactions and their relation, it is possible to execute them and observe the behaviour.

Currently, just the Standard Transaction Pattern is implemented.

## Running

The web build runs at [https://ccmi-fit.github.io/DEMOSim](https://ccmi-fit.github.io/DEMOSim).
[Sample models](https://github.com/CCMi-FIT/DEMOSim-models) are available.

It is possible also to run DEMOsim locally and/or build desktop versions using instructions at [this page](https://github.com/emilk/eframe_template).
